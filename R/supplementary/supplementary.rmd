# S1 - detailed math description of both models

# S2 - descriptive stats about parasites 

(morph and population specific prevalence, as well as min/mean/median/max CI abundance and/or intensities)


# S3 - pairwise posterior comparisons for each trait

# S4 -  Posterior proportion of total variance associated with fixed effects vs. random effects, for both behavioural traits with repeated measures. 

See **Methods** and **Supplementary Material 1** for a description of the model underlying these estimates.
