data in `.csv` format are in the `data` folder, R script in `.Rmd` format (including detailed information about the analysis) in the `R` folder.

This folder is a RStudio project folder, and the script uses the here package (see also [here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)) to ensure all files paths are relative. If you run the script for the first time, models and some other time-consuming outputs will be saved in the `R_output` folder so you don't have to re-run them everytime.
